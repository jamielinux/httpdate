    RFC 9110 criteria for the HTTP date field includes the following:

      - It must be in one of the three accepted formats.
      - It must represent time as an instance of UTC.
      - It must represent weekday names and month names in English.
      - It is case-sensitive.
      - It must not have any additional whitespace.
      - It must be semantically correct (eg, the weekday must be the correct weekday).
      - It can include leap seconds (eg, `23:59:60`).
      - It must represent a year of `1900` or above.

    second semantically correct if it's an official leap second.
